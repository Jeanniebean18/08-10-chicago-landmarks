#Lemonly's Front-end Project Boilerplate
#####v1.1.0b

###Based on these projects:
* [HTML5 Boilerplate](https://html5boilerplate.com/)
* [Abessive Theme](https://github.com/joshbroton/abessive)
* [Sassquatch](https://github.com/joshbroton/sassquatch)
* Lemonly HTML/CSS/JS Style Guides

###Changes:
* reset-normalize.scss replaced with normalize.csss, which is based on the HTML5 Boilerplate v5.0.0 CSS normalize.
* Refine the variables used for base styles.
* Refine build task so text replacement is no longer needed for cache-busting.
* Local branch changes:
    * Added a [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) grunt task for ES6 support
    * Changed app.js to app.es6
